## About Gamebox Panel
Started by 19 year old Kyle Staschke, I needed a control panel which was clean, easy to use, and had more features than what other paid game panels offered. I was starting a hosting company and TCAdmin was a choice for me but it was not as clean and well built as I would of liked but it did provide functionality. My goal in the next year of development is to wow the gaming community with both outstanding features for very low prices as I am not in this for money but to provide resources that anyone can use. Of course my I will have to have paid features as my time is limited to work on this project.

## Pricing, Is it free?
I am not 100% certain on what the pricing format will be but below is an example of what I currently have in mind.

### Free Plan Features

 - 1 Remote Machine
 - Unlimited Game Servers
 - No Support

### $3.29 / mo Features

 - Unlimited Remote Machines
 - Unlimited Game Servers
 - Support Requests

## Can I Help?
Sure, I take pull requests here as this will be a community project for the most part but our main repo is a private git hub repository. This will only be open source for the Alpha versions as for licensing a security reasons I will have to encrypt the source code to distribute it. Also note, I will not be puting the licensing code in the public repository for this reason.

## Questions
You can email me at kstaschke@gameboxpanel.ga with any questions that you may have. I will update everything here as more information comes out.
